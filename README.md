Finds the shortest route between two cities (by highway) and draws it on a map. This requires a number of files that I'm not sure I'm allowed to republish, so it's not going to work if you try to run it. That being said, it demonstrates a number of concepts:

* Reading text/binary files
* Hashtables
* Priority queue using minheap
* Shortest path algorithm
* Taking coordinates and drawing them on a maps of various sizes
